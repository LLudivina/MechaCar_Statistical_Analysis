## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

In this case, both vehicle_length and ground_clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the MPG values.  This is because both p-values are smaller than our assumed 0.05 percent significance level. Therefore, we would state that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and accept that there is a significant difference in mpg and a coefficient.

The p-value of our regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is smaller than an assumed significance level of 0.05%.  Therefore, it can be said that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which means that the slope of the this linear model is not zero. 

The model does not predit mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
